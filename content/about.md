Hi, I'm **Onurhan Ak**. I am a Linux-focused DevOps and Systems Engineer with a strong background in automation, provisioning, and data infrastructure. I’m RHCSA-certified and currently working as a Linux SysAdmin at the University of British Columbia.

### What I Do

- Linux and cloud administration.
- Automate provisioning and deployment with **Ansible** and **Docker Compose**
- Build ETL and system automation tools using **Python**, **Go**, and **Bash**
- Manage Linux environments and research workloads on **SLURM clusters**
- Harden systems using **SELinux**, **firewalld**, and secure SSH configurations

### Experience

- **UBC** — streamlined Linux dev environments, automated backup pipelines, and maintained userspace configurations for AI workflows.
- **Freelance** — deployed and maintained Linux servers for clients, refactored broken scripts, and trained non-technical users on SSH and Linux basics.
